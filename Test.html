									<h1>Testing & Risks</h1>
								</header>
								<h2>Testing</h2>
								<p>To begin with, we need to understand the common software development process and model, mainly understand the related knowledge of agile development. Then, it is necessary for us to learn the definition of software testing, the division of cents, the testing process, the method of writing test cases, the management of bugs and the period of life. Then, we must understand the common test points and test methods of web and app. Finally, it is necessary to write common test documents, such as bug lists, test plans, software test reports, etc. (Kirsty F)</p>
								<p>Once we finish the prototype of the design. We are expecting to find a group of people around the world to test our app. This group of people as well as their cultures can be various due to its globalization. We will release 100 quotas for each region, thereby, we expect 1000 people around the world to test the prototype. </p>
								<p>Firstly, we will make an Advertisement about the app to invite people to test our prototype. We are planning to give them some little gifts once they finished the Closed beta test about our app. The amount of gift for each tester might be different as it is according to the activeness of using the app during the beta. The gift can be some restaurant discount coupons (we expect to fetch the coupons from the restaurant for free because the app is also another way to promote the field of eating). Secondly, we will release our testing patch for them to download when 80% the quotas have booked, and people can still book the quotas even the server is already on. Once the download is released, we will turn on the server for 14 days, during these days, testers can post any food they want, the cooking method, as well as the place where people can taste delicious food. </p>
								<p>Then, after the 14 days is passed, testers will be invited to do a survey at the end of the beta. In the aspect of collecting feedback from the testers, testers not only can provide their responses after the beta, but also during the data by sending email to us or using the feedback function in the app, so we can get the feedback quicker. We will make our best efforts to improve the app according to the responses from the testers.</p>
								<h2>Risks</h2>
								<h3>1. The technology difficulties</h3>
								<p>The programming language seems to be difficult to learn for us as newcomers of programming. To be able to create a mature application with all the function like importing GPS (to allocate the restaurant), booking function ( book the restaurant) and online chatting function may takes about one or two years of developing for a small team like us. </p>
								<p>On the other hand, there is no group member study designing of the user interface and the appearance of the application. We may need to hire somebody to design for us or we need to learn some knowledge to be able to design by ourselves. </p>
								<h3>2. Other Risks after the Foodie created</h3>
								<p>Foodie as a food application it is very vital to make sure the quality of the restaurant, but for a small team like us may not have the abilities to control the qualities of many restaurants around the world. The fake or bad restaurant may bring bad reputation for Foodie. </p>
								<p>Foodie creates different class for foods from different cultures, it is important to write description for different culture foods. We may need to hire several professionals to help us set up the classification of different culture food. </p>
								<p>As we mention before, foodie may contain online chatting function, and which leads to the problem of securing user’s privacies. As a mature food application, we may use machine learning to adapt user’s food habit and recommend foods they probably like from what the user usually search in our application. But it may use user’s personal information for the Ai to analyze. It is better for us to set up rules to protect user’s privacies.</p>
