								<h2>Procreate</h2>
								<p>A good application not only depend on the code it also requires a good UI design, an interesting UI will be more attractive to users with several UI design skills will improve the using experiences. Most of the members in our group are using IOS and MAC system then we decided to use Procreate as our draft drawing application. Procreate is a drawing application which especially design for iPad. Compared to paper drawing, firstly, Procreate is more efficient, user can easily erase and edit the error without destroy the original piece. Secondly, the Procreate contain various drawing tools pack and various colors to choose. (Gabs Art Tips, 2020) Thirdly, Procreate can save the drafts it is safer than storing the papers. On the other hand, Procreate can easily share the draft with other members in the group and others can edit the draft online.  To use this app, we will have to purchase from the App Store at USD 9.99. To have the best outcome from the app, we will use another hardware, Apple Pencil to make our sketches or low fidelity prototype. Because most of us are not in Melbourne currently after using Procreate can achieve remote working. </p>
								<h2>Figma</h2>
								<p>Figma is wonderful application for us to arrange the UI also suitable for a small team like us, Figma is like simulator for testing the front-end of an application. We choose Figma because one of the best functions of Figma is it supporting the online editing for all the group members. It reveals the process of designing and save the costs of communication. Compared to Sketch, Figma is not only a UI designing tool, Figma combine Invision, Zeplin, Dropbox, liveshare and Overflow. It likely covers most of the area of designing digital products. (Kopf, 2018) An example for how efficient the Figma is, the simplest process without using Figma is: Firstly, use Sketch finish the designing of the UI, secondly upload the draft to Invision to make interactive prototype, finally upload to Zeplin to hand over to the engineer, however, all these steps can be done within Figma. Normally, we would have to pay subscription fees, however, RMIT University provides access to Figma to the students. Using both tools, we will develop a prototype of the application. </p>
								<p>The inspiration for this application was initially due to a food lover from the team who discovered that the functionality of the food application is relatively single, and the UI interaction is crude, which is not very effective and friendly to the users, and is unattractive to more users, there is no one or two or three mature applications that have created a monopoly or oligarchy in the market. There are still many potential users. In recent years, people’s lifestyles have been improving along with their living standards, and their requirements for food have also got higher. More and more people are beginning to abandon fast food, looking for healthier eating habits and preferences. Therefore, the team decided to filter and combine the functions of some classic gourmet application and improve and perfect them to create an application with comprehensive functions and a novel user interface which is easy to operate.</p>
								<h2>Coding</h2>
								<p>To create or write the application require various programming languages. To set up the system and UI we want to use Java to accomplish. After a few studies of Python, C++ and Java I found out that Java is one of the commonest used and requires comparatively less programming skills kind of language. Java unlike Python it has more uses and ductility for making an application. Compare to C++ Java is easier to learn and use. Java is kind of language that direct facing the object it is easier to understand and program. Another important thing for it is that Java has a better flexibility to connect to other language if the application required. It makes it suitable for execute in different platform. Java as a kind of scripting language it contains various class storage for different function, for example Java can run multithreading and be able to connect the internet which is a significant function for an online food application like our Foodie. Also, Java has a useful function for delete the duplicates that wasting the storages. (Team, 2019) Unlike C++ Java has simplify the language it removed those confusing things for example the pointers which brought me a lot of troubles when I’m coding C++. I think another group member will learn Java soon during their bachelor of IT. (www.javatpoint.com, n.d.) </p>
								<h2>Web</h2>
								<p>	The Foodie also require official website to put advertisement and detail information, I think it is better to use JSON. In most of the programming languages they contain the function to read JSON that makes it a common and normalized web language. (www.w3schools.com, n.d.) JSON and CSS provide our website more interesting and artistic user interface. CSS and JSON have more function than normal html, the interactive function will make our website vivid and several design with CSS and JSON may keep our users’ interests. (W3schools.com, 2019) </p>
								<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
								<p>To implement the machine learning function for Foodie (learn and analyze the food habit the favor of the user.) We decided to use TensorFlow for accomplish machine learning in Foodie, TensorFlow is mathematic system based on the dataflow programming. It is commonly using in machine learning the former of it is DisBelief of Google. TensorFlow has multi-layer structure can be place in websites, PC clients and servers. It supports the high computing from GPU and TPU. (www.tutorialspoint.com, n.d.) The reason for us to choose TensorFlow:</p>
								<h3>1. The usability and adaptability (www.javatpoint.com, n.d.)</h3>
								<p>The working process of TensorFlow is kind of simple compared to other machine learning system. It has a stable API, good compatibility and very fast compile speed which allows programmer to iterate easier and smoother. </p>
								<h3>2. The flexibility (www.javatpoint.com, n.d.)</h3>
								<p>TensorFlow can be use in different devices, it can be run in multiple GPU and CPU. Also, TensorFlow support Java so that we can implement it into our application. </p>
								<h3>3. The supporting from the community</h3>
								<p>TensorFlow was developed by Google, and it aim to be commonly used by programmers, besides, Google also use it for their program and keep provide supports for it. Therefore, TensorFlow formed a powerful community, the resources in the community may be helpful for our team to use.</p>
