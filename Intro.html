								</header>
								<h2>Topic</h2>
								<p>Foodie application is the social media-based food platform for the users for many ages or different generations. Users can be ranged from pre-teens or teenagers to middle aged people or elders. Moreover, this app will also help the users to food lovers to record and classify delicious food information including the information of the restaurants and dishes they would serve, recipes of several dishes to recreate at home and required ingredients. Foodie will allow you to see and give the sense of idea what restaurant’s dishes look like in reality due to the AR function of the app. Moreover, Foodie will allow our users to keep records of the food they consume so that they will be able to track to have a healthier life. </p>
								<p>Possibly, best outcome of this Foodie project would be connecting and communicating food lovers across various places like ever before. For instance, users will be able to stay up to date with current food trends in the community. We hope Foodie will be able to spark some form of creativity or self-expression in food lovers and able to share. Finally, we would love to see people leading a healthier app because of this app.</p>
								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>Every day, people must consume food in their daily life. But to some people, food has become biggest part of their life. Many people have built their life around food like chefs, restaurant owners, etc. Coincidentally, our group, Techie Gang, also happens to fill with food lovers. We all love and have appreciation for the food to some degree. Moreover, many of us come from different cultural background and we would like to share food, recipes, ideas, and local dishes among the group members. In our free time, we always try different delicious food in different cities. However, we have faced some troubles to share ideas on food. In the world filled with IT technologies and trends, more than half of the world uses some form of social media. Even simple yet complex image based social media like Instagram is raising rapidly (Chaffey, 2021). Due to this fact, the idea of food-based application media platform rises from our group.</p>
								<h2>Landscape</h2>
								<p>	After our group does our own research on mobile biggest app market, Apple’s App Store, food-based application can be found on the market. For instance, there are food delivery app like Uber Eats or Menulog are commonly found in Australian App Store. Moreover, restaurants will have their own version of their app like Domino’s or KFC to deliver the food to their customers. Application like Zomato can be found to view about restaurants in town and its review along with delivery features. What all the exampled applications have in common and doesn’t have in common are delivery features and sharing food ideas respectively. This is where our Foodie comes in. The ability to share food ideas along with other features will make our app different from competitor applications on the market.</p>
