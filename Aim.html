								<h2>Aims</h2>
								<p>	People nowadays always hardly make decision on what to eat. Why not us to give them suggestion on food choices? Our food app which is called Foodie is aimed to give people guides and recommendations to decide what to eat. By the development of Foodie, we are aimed to build an online food community. We provide a channel to connect our users and business. Restaurants can put their information and advertisement in Foodie advertise themselves. In addition, our users can make comments in these restaurants as well. Positive comments can be a kind of advertisements to show to other users. Negative comments can be advice to help restaurants to improve their quantity (These negative comments will be showed to other users as well.). </p>
								<p>Furthermore, we prefer to cooperate with restaurants to push out our exclusive discount. For example, we provide code on the APP and people can use these codes to get 10% discount when they pay the bill. But most of these codes will not come without foundation. There will be few ways which users can earn these codes. We are planning to design an exclusive system to let our users to earn points and exchange discounts. Firstly, giving comments or sharing photos. We are aimed to set this feature as one of the most popular and basic way to earn points. As the basic feature of our APP, number of active users is like the lifeline of us. Using free points to attract our users to write comments and experiences or take photos of restaurants to keep number of active users. Secondly, old user can invite new users to download our APP. New users can choose to enter invitation code which was given by old users, and both can earn points. Thirdly, we will provide some activities based on seasonal and demand of market such as black Friday and new store opening. Users can earn points or discount codes by taking part in these activities. All these actions we are used to bring more users and keep number of active users of our APP. With the increasing of active users, chances which cooperate with restaurants and advertising will increase at the same time. We are aimed to build an online environment of food communication. And there will be more profit we can make. </p>
								<h2>The Beginning</h2>
								<p>This project aims to develop a gourmet application to provide users with the recipes they need and nearby restaurants. After comparing the projects from all team members, the team chose this gourmet application for in-depth research and development. The reason is that once this application is developed, it will gain a larger market and make the most profits for the company among the six projects. Therefore, it stands out among the six projects and becomes the most preferred one of the team.</p>
								<p>The inspiration for this application was initially due to a food lover from the team who discovered that the functionality of the food application is relatively single, and the UI interaction is crude, which is not very effective and friendly to the users, and is unattractive to more users, there is no one or two or three mature applications that have created a monopoly or oligarchy in the market. There are still many potential users. In recent years, people’s lifestyles have been improving along with their living standards, and their requirements for food have also got higher. More and more people are beginning to abandon fast food, looking for healthier eating habits and preferences. Therefore, the team decided to filter and combine the functions of some classic gourmet application and improve and perfect them to create an application with comprehensive functions and a novel user interface which is easy to operate.</p>
								<h2>Progress</h2>
								<p>Initially, this project was conceived and framed by one of the team members as a personal project ideal. In his personal project, he completed the planning of the initial basic functions of this application, including recipe search and restaurant recommendation, and added the function of diet health monitoring and sharing to social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. He also completed the initial design plan of the UI and listed the technologies and tools for developing this application.</p>
								<h2>Scope & Limits</h2>
								<p>	The scope or the area of focus of this assignment is to make a project plan and convey the outcome or the results of this project. The main reason to develop the food app in this project to help users connect via food. When the food app is made into a reality, users will be allowed to communicate with another foodie locally or globally. Social media specifically targeted toward food for the users is the primary goal in this project. In addition, users can search nearby restaurants using google map. Users can go to search bars and type in the name of the restaurants. The list of the nearby restaurants will also be displayed for the users.  </p>
								<p>	Since five sixth of our members are in first semester of first year of the university, we barely have knowledge to build or program a literal app. This has become our group’s obvious limitation or setback. However, this limitation comes with its advantages. It has allowed us to focus on other aspect of the project idea. For instance, we can spend more time and energy into planning productively about the main features in our food app in the beginning phase of group project and comes up with the template UI for app. We will be using services like Figma to convey our ideas of features and how users can interact the application without having to program an app. </p>
